# Project Overview
- Built the python machine learning model predicting tomorrowâ€™s S&P 500 index price data from yfinance package
- Trained a random forest model and used back testing on 20+ years of data with about 57% precision score

1. Downloaded some stock data (S&P 500 index)
2. Cleaned and Visualized data
3. Set up machine learning target
4. Trained our initial model
5. Evaluated the error over the long period of time and created a way to do back-test
6. Improved the model with extra predictive column
